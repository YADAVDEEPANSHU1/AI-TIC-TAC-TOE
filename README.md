# AI-TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C++, where the player competes against an AI opponent.
The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it always makes the optimal move.
The game is simple, lightweight, and runs entirely in the terminal without requiring any external libraries.
It demonstrates basic concepts of artificial intelligence, game theory, and recursive algorithms
